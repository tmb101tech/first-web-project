				<h3>Some Article</h3>
				Unless you’ve already had some experience with jQuery, this probably looks like gibberish.
				There’s actually a lot going on here that won’t become clear until much later.
				What jQuery is doing for us here is making sure that the browser has loaded all of the
				HTML before executing our JavaScript (which is currently just a single console.log).
				Whenever we’re working with browser-based JavaScript, we’ll be doing this just to
				establish the practice: any JavaScript you write will go between the $(docu
				ment).ready(function() { and }); lines. Also note the line 'use strict'; this is
				something we’ll learn more about later, but basically this tells the JavaScript interpreter
				to treat your code more rigorously. While that may not sound like a good thing
				at first, it actually helps you write better JavaScript, and prevents common and
				difficult-to-diagnose problems. We’ll certainly be learning to write very rigorous Java‐
				Script in this book!
